## Hi there 👋

I'm new here. I confess that I've always been curious to know what GitHub was all about. I knew it involved the world of technology and development, but not in such depth. Even though I've worked in that world, I wasn't a developer. I work more in the area of ​​technology project management and no, not as a product owner.

I ended up here because I'm migrating from Windows to Linux and because when using Wine I couldn't run an .exe program due to a missing dependency and to report a missing dependency: GitHub.

Here's how I got started here. And I loved it. A lot!

It reminds me a bit of DevOps, but the world of open source is beautiful, isn't it?

I'm excited to be able to contribute and perhaps receive contributions related to my interests.

## Well, what can I say about myself?

🕵️‍♀️ Although I didn't become a software developer, since I was a child I've always been very interested in hardware and software and the world of technology;

🔭 I have an entrepreneurship project with a socio-environmental impact (technology-based);

🌱 I am currently delving deeper into the business plan to validate the idea and into knowledge related to innovation with a socio-environmental impact;

⚡ I am an administrator, project manager, bilingual (Portuguese and Spanish), I have a blog (https://insaitch.com.br/) and a YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/@insaitch).

In this socio-environmental impact project (future, if validated) I would be very interested in knowing and delving deeper into the location mechanism used by the Tinder app (programming languages ​​used, how it works, etc.). So, following GitHub's idea for the README "- 🤔 I'm looking for help with ..." I would greatly appreciate suggestions and/or more knowledge related to the structure of the Tinder app.

But, it is not a priority for now. First VALIDATE THE IDEA and evaluate the viability of the business, Bruna.

I don't know yet if this works like a social network where you can add friends or follow someone, but if so, feel free to connect with me here.

And good work to you, and to us!
